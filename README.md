  Key Items to Look for in Suspicious Emails 

Below are some examples of actual phishing and scam emails, in which the most common or key markers of 
phishing emails are indicated.

*Example Spam/Phishing Email Message #1* 

1. UVA will never send a message like this. Even if you were to ask UVA to delete your account 
(highly unlikely).

2. The tone of urgency, indicated by a 24-hour deadline, along with an implied threat, indicated by the 
words "your account will be lost". A tone of urgency and an implied or veiled threat to those who do 
not act will generate fear, a key tactic phishers use to deceive us, and to push us to act without 
thinking.

3. Hover over any included links (i.e. hypertext, graphics, buttons) before clicking them. As seen above, 
the hyperlink text says it will "CANCEL REQUEST IMMEDIATELY", but when you hover over the link, you 
see that the actual URL takes you away from servers. Clicking this link would make your information and 
data available to hackers.

*Example Spam/Phishing Email Message #2*

1. hackers sometimes become aware of legitimate email campaigns and recreate legitimate language. 
For this reason, it is very important to always read the entire message to ensure its validity.

*!* This is a reminder of the importance of hovering over URLs before clicking them â€” the URL that 
appears to take you to "netbadge.virginia.edu/myaccount/reactivation.html" does NOT take you to a 
website. Despite this seemingly valid message, there is always a way to find the phish. *!* 

3. hackers often use legitimate content in an attempt to trick into clicking the malicious content. this 
email address appears to be a legitimate virginia.edu message, though notice discrepancies between 
the apparent URL and the real URL above.
